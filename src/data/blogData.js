      title: "Manchester United react to reports of the club sacking Erik Ten Hag",
      category: "sports",
      content: `Manchester United have reportedly addressed reports indicating that the club is considering sacking the current head coach, Erik Ten Hag, following the woeful results so far this season.
        Reports surrounding the future of Erik Ten Hag surfaced on social media after Manchester United's woeful defeat at the hands of Newcastle in the Carabao Cup round of 16 fixture played on Wednesday, November 1, 2023.
        Reports indicate that some players in the dressing room have been unhappy with the manager's style of play with others, indicating that more players are often favoured over others. According to sports journalist Fabrizio Romano, the board of directors at the club has denied the reports indicating that the head coach is being backed by the club regardless of the results.
        ETH, in the post-match interview after the 3-0 loss to Newcastle, spoke about his future at the club; he revealed that he is not worried about his future at the club as he is a fighter and would definitely work towards getting his side to bounce back to winning ways. He said, 'I'm a fighter and I know it's not always going up and we have a lot of setbacks this season so far, but you also have to deal with it and it's never an excuse. I have said before, when there are setbacks, the routines, the way of play are not similar, not the same, but even then you have to get the results in. Obviously, Sunday and tonight was far from that. We have to do things right, at a certain level, a minimum level to win games. I understand the scrutiny. 
        When the results are not there then there is a logical process questioning that. I am confident I can do it. I have done it at all my clubs and also last year, I did it here as well. But at this moment, we are also in a bad place. I take responsibility for it. I see it as a challenge, I'm a fighter, I am in the fight and I have to make sure I share the responsibility with the players that we stick together, fight together and get better results in.'`

      title: "Android’s new real-time app scanning aims to combat malicious sideloaded apps",
      category: "security",
      content: `Android’s in-built security engine Google Play Protect has a new feature that conducts a real-time analysis of an Android app’s code and blocks it from installing the app if it’s considered potentially harmful.
        Google announced in October the new real-time app scanning feature built into Google Play Protect that the company says can help catch malicious or fake sideloaded apps installed from outside the app store. These apps will morph their appearance or use AI to alter the apps’ code in a way that helps them avoid detection.
        Google said this Play Protect feature now recommends a real-time app scan for any new app that has never been scanned before. This consists of a code analysis that will “extract important signals from the app and send them to the Play Protect backend infrastructure for a code-level evaluation.”
        Android’s app store has billions of apps that Google screens for malware, though not always successfully. Many device owners also take to sideloading Android apps, which skirt the app store altogether and its many lines of defense. Sideloading remains a popular feature for Android users, even if it means having to trust that the app they are installing is not malicious.
        One of the key reasons for Google to introduce its enhanced real-time code-level scanning feature is to counter the proliferation of predatory loan apps. These apps have resulted in the harassment of users, leading in some cases to victims taking their own lives. Bad actors gain access to user data, including contacts and photos, which are used to bully users. TechCrunch extensively covered the impact of predatory loan apps on Indian users. Google also said it took down over 3,500 such apps in the year for violating its policy requirements. Attackers still find ways to target their victims.
        One of the key reasons for Google to introduce its enhanced real-time code-level scanning feature is to counter the proliferation of predatory loan apps.

Bad actors gain access to user data, including contacts and photos, which are used to bully users. TechCrunch extensively covered the impact of predatory loan apps on Indian users. Google also said it took down over 3,500 such apps in the year for violating its policy requirements. Attackers still find ways to target their victims.
        Google initially launched the Play Protect update in India, with plans to soon expand internationally. TechCrunch tried the feature out for ourselves by loading a phone with a variety of malicious and bad apps to see what would make it through.
        We tried to install more than 30 different malicious apps, from stalkerware and spyware to predatory loan apps and fake ripoffs of popular apps. Google Play Protect blocked nearly all of the malicious apps with warnings like, “Apps from unknown developers can sometimes be unsafe,” and “This app tries to spy on your personal data, such as SMS messages, photos, audio recordings, or call history,” or, “This app is fake.” A handful of recently created predatory loan apps, however, were successfully installed.
        We began the testing on the Pixel 7a by trying to install various spyware apps that have rebranded or been cloned, or otherwise had code changes that would attempt to evade detection. (We’re not naming or linking to the apps given their malicious nature.) Commercial surveillance apps, like stalkerware or spouseware, are typically surreptitiously installed by someone with physical access to a person’s phone, often a spouse or domestic partner. These spyware apps silently and continually upload the contents of the person’s phone, including messages, photos, and real-time location data, and present a major security and privacy risk to the people whose phones are compromised.`

      category: "security",
      content: `Mortgage and loan giant Mr. Cooper says a “cybersecurity incident” earlier this week was the cause of an ongoing outage, adding that the company is “working to resolve the issue.”
        The Texas-based company said in a statement on its website that on October 31, Mr. Cooper “became the target of a cyber security incident and took immediate steps to lock down our systems in order to keep your data safe.”
        In a separate notice, Mr. Cooper said it is “actively investigating this event to determine if any data has been compromised.”
        Mr. Cooper is a home loan, mortgage refinancing and debt collection giant with more than 4.1 million customers, according to its website, which appears to be largely down at the time of writing.
        The company said in its statement that customers “will not incur any fees, penalties or negative credit reporting.”
        Mr. Cooper initially described the incident as an “outage” in messages to customers that TechCrunch has seen.
        It’s not clear when Mr. Cooper expects to bring its systems back to operation, or if the company has the technical ability to determine what customer data, if any, was stolen.
        When reached by email, a spokesperson representing Mr. Cooper via a third-party public relations firm sent a boilerplate statement echoing the company’s public remarks and declined to answer our questions about the incident.
        In a filing with federal regulators on Thursday, Mr. Cooper said it does not anticipate the cybersecurity incident having a material adverse effect on its business, operations or financial results.`

      title: "Retailers from JCPenney to Tiffany & Co are funnelling huge sums into store renovations. They're hoping massive akeoverswill drive shoppers to spend.",
      category: "business",
      "content": `At JCPenney stores across the US, shoppers may notice a fresh paint smell, better lighting and shiny new signage – with even more improvements planned for the coming months. Centralised checkout counters are replacing registers once spread across multiple departments, and posters promise a "new and improved shopping experience" once the remodels are complete. Change is afoot at the retailer, and not just in the form of upgraded carpet (though that, too, is on the list).
        The updates are part of a $1bn (£808m) investment the company announced in late August – a pricey effort to reinvigorate the brand following a high profile 2020 bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring. The funds will be partly dedicated to slicker technology and improved e-commerce features, but much of the focus remains on JCPenney's more than 650 physical stores. 
        As a numbers game, this makes sense for the American department store chain: brick-and-mortar sales account for about 70% of the company's revenue, so enticing people to keep making those in-person trips will be crucial to recovery.
        Beyond that, in surveys and focus groups, shoppers continue to emphasise the importance of stores, says Katie Mullen, JCPenney's chief customer officer. "Our customer tells us that they care about the store environment," she says. "They tell us that they care about product availability, and they tell us that they care about inspiration."
        JCPenney is among the companies doubling down on their retail presences, for many different reasons. It may be surprising amid the recent narrative, in which experts and shoppers alike have declared once-thriving malls dead due to retailers' losing battles against Amazon, economic challenges, demographic shifts and better-managed competition. Indeed, vacant storefronts across the US have been converted to apartment complexes, pickleball courts, medical centres, coworking spaces and entertainment venues.
        But while these trends paint a bearish picture of the future of traditional physical retail, some companies are making moves that suggest they still see in-store shopping as an opportunity for growth. Their strategies differ, but each are catering to what consumers say they want – and need.
        These are the decisions every retailer today must face, says Brown. "Are they going to improve their supply chain? Their online experience? Their in-store experience? It's a matter of choices, and they're choosing the things that they can and can't afford to do at any given time."`

      title: "Business in Russia: Why some firms haven't left",
      category: "business",
      content: `When the first airstrikes fell on Ukraine in February 2022, corporate executives with operations or holdings in Russia were forced to pick a side. This decision had significant implications. Russia remains a major business market, with a population of 145 million; its 2022 GDP was a staggering $2.24tn (£1.81tn), right behind France. Fleeing companies would leave a lot of revenue on the table.
        Yet amid a gruelling war, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and widespread international condemnation of Russia, companies risked severe reputational damage by staying put. Plus, a mix of international pressure, sanctions and risks of Russian government interference offered strong reasons for companies to leave when the conflict began.
        "Some decided to stay, some decided to go very quickly, and some dragged their feet," says Roman Sidortsov, an associate professor of energy policy at Michigan Technological University, US, who practised corporate law and taught in Russia.
        One of the biggest companies to pull out almost immediately was British Petroleum, which exited just three days after the conflict began. By 1 March, BMW also announced it would halt Russian production and imports. And after first announcing a plan to leave Russia in March 2022, Heineken sold off its Russian business to Russian packaging firm Arnest for a single euro this August, taking a €300m ($319m; £257m) loss on the division.
        Experts disagree on exactly how many companies have left Russia – and what constitutes a 'full departure'. The Kyiv School of Economics Institute, which tracks the status of foreign companies selling or operating in Russia through its Leave Russia project, estimates around 300 have left.
        According to a similar list compiled by the Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), roughly a thousand companies have exited.  
        However, hundreds of foreign companies continue to operate in, or sell to, Russia. The KSE Institute claims 1,
            400 companies are still conducting business in some form within the country; by the CELI’s count, around 500 companies are doing so.
        A recognisable name on the KSE list is PepsiCo. In early September, Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention accused the multinational soft-drink giant of continuing to produce food products in Russia despite it discontinuing Pepsi-Cola,
            7Up and Miranda production. 
        Tech and finance giants, including Chinese firm Alibaba, also continue to conduct business there, as does British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. Airlines including Emirates, China Eastern and Air Serbia still openly advertise flights to Russia on their websites. Other businesses, like Indian refiner Chennai Petroleum, are gearing up instead of exiting: the company is expanding its services to Russia because of the invasion. 
        Critics of companies that have remained in Russia, including Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute founder Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, denounce these businesses as greedy, or even complicit in Russia's invasion. But ceasing operations in a country with such major business implications isn't simple. Some businesses remain because of a lack of pressure on them to leave, or due to an existential threat. Others believe staying is the most humane option for their consumers.`

        It’s week five of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial and a lot has happened for the former CEO of FTX.
        He testified in front of jurors, for numerous days, after doing a hearing testimony without them present.
        While we would have preferred to learn more about what transpired from the man behind the madness himself, he offered little context, especially when asked about his prior decisions and actions during cross-examination with prosecutors. In total, he said a whole lot of nothing, and yet, everything in his testimony, all at the same time (TC+). Bankman-Fried said “Yup” 372 times, “Not sure” 117 times and “I don’t remember” 73 times, for context.
        Now his verdict lies in the hands of 12 jurors, who will determine whether Bankman-Fried is guilty of seven charges related to fraud and money laundering.
        With that said, our crypto coverage was all-in on SBF’s trial this past week, so let’s get into it.`

      title: "Why Amaju Pinnick is reportedly suing Davido for N2.3 billion",
      category: "news",
      content: `The former head of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Afrobeats star Davido, and here's why.
        Before this lawsuit, the former head of the Nigerian Football Federation had laid claims against the international superstar for failing to honour an agreement between both parties in which Davido had been paid to perform at the 19th edition of Warri Again. The event organisers had to replace Davido with Afropluto singer Shallipopi.
        After much back and forth by both parties, Brownhill Investments Company Limited, owned by a former President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, filed a lawsuit marked EHC/183/2023 before the Delta State High Court in Effurun against the superstar and his record label.
        During the 19th edition of the Warri event, the previous leader of the NFF reiterated that no artist in Nigeria could surpass the importance of Warri. He made comparisons between Davido and renowned figures like Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD), Burna Boy, and Alibaba. Event organisers had spent $94,
            600 on Davido's performance and another $18,
            000 on the private plane for Davido and his crew.
        Amaju Pinnick had said at the event, “We paid Davido $94,
            600 on the 6th of April. We paid $18,
            000 for his plane. If he says he’s a big boy, we will tell him we are bigger than him. I’m not joking. So, while he was playing his games back and forth, we decided to hunt to find another artiste, Shallipopi. You see, when people say they are big, I’m amazed. Is Burna Boy not the biggest artiste in Nigeria today? Burna Boy is half Itsekiri. Burna Boy’s paternal grandmother is Itsekiri. So, he’s bigger than him (Davido). Is there anyone bigger than RMD in the acting industry? Or someone bigger than Ali Baba in the comedy industry? We have stars aplenty in Warri. Nobody is bigger than Warri."`

      title: "Caster Semenya: Double Olympic champion 'not ashamed of being different'",
      category: "news",
      content: `Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya says she is "not going to be ashamed" of being "different", and will "fight for what is right" amid her ongoing dispute with athletics authorities.
        Semenya,
            32, was born with differences of sexual development (DSD) and cannot compete in female track events without taking testosterone-reducing drugs.
        The South African wants to hold World Athletics to account for what she says is discrimination against athletes with hyperandrogenism and recently said she is turning her attention to "winning battles against the authorities" rather than collecting medals, with competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics no longer a goal.
        In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent, Semenya says:
        She felt she was "different" from the age of five but "embraces" her differences
        She will not conform "to be accepted"
        She wants to empower women to "have a voice""Leaders" in sport are "turning women against women"
        Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition characterised by higher than usual levels of testosterone, a hormone that increases muscle mass and strength.
        Under regulations introduced in 2018, athletes with DSD were only allowed to compete in female track events between 400m and the mile if they reduced their testosterone levels.
        In March, World Athletics ruled that DSD athletes must now have hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before being eligible to compete in all female events.
        "For me I believe if you are a woman, you are a woman," said Semenya, who won Olympic 800m gold in 2012 and 2016 and is a three-time world champion over the same distance.
        "No matter the differences you have. I have realised I want to live my life and fight for what I think and I believe in myself."I know I am a woman and anything that comes along with it just accept it."
        Semenya ran in the 5,
            000m at last year's World Championships in Oregon but failed to qualify for the final.
        In July, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in her favour in a case related to testosterone levels in female athletes.
        "At the end of the day, I know I am different. I don't care about the medical terms or what they tell me. Being born without a uterus or internal testicles. Those don't make me less of a woman," added Semenya.
        "Those are the differences I was born with and I will embrace them. I am not going to be ashamed because I am different. I am different and special and I feel great about it."It comes with why we fight for women's sport. The importance of women's sport is not being taken seriously and we need to take charge of our own bodies. Decide what is right for us. Not another gender deciding what we should look like."If we are woman enough or not, it is up to us. We know and believe in what is right, then why must we stop."
        The case at the ECHR was not against sporting bodies or DSD rules - but specifically against the government of Switzerland for not protecting Semenya's rights and dates back to a Swiss Supreme Court ruling three years ago.
        The ECHR found the Swiss government did not protect Semenya from being discriminated against when its Supreme Court refused to overturn a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), which upheld the World Athletics rules.
        The case has now been referred to the Grand Chamber of the ECHR for a final ruling following a referral request from the Swiss government.`

      title: "New polls find Trump leading Biden in key swing states ahead of US presidential election",
      category: "news",
      content: `Former US President Donald Trump holds an edge over President Joe Biden according to new polls conducted among registered voters in four key swing states
        According to the new poll from The New York Times and Siena College, in Nevada, a state Biden narrowly carried in the 2020 presidential election, Trump boasts 52% support to Biden’s 41%. Trump also tops Biden in Georgia, a state that was central to his ploy to overturn the last presidential election, with 49% to Biden’s 43%.
        In Arizona, Trump leads Biden, too, with 49% to the current president’s 44%. In Michigan, Trump holds a 5-point lead as well: 48% to Biden’s 43%.
        In Pennsylvania, a state Trump won in 2016 but Biden recaptured in 2020, Trump is at 48% to Biden’s 44%.
        Each poll has a margin of sampling error between 4.4 and 4.8 points, and the head-to-head matchup remains theoretical as primary voting does not begin until next year.
        In Wisconsin, meanwhile, Biden takes 47% to Trump’s 45%, well within the survey’s margin of error.
        Trump is the Republican party front-runner, while Biden, who drew a primary challenge from Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips last month, is heavily favored for the Democratic nomination.
        The latest battleground state polling underscores the considerable challenges facing Biden’s reelection bid, including low job approval ratings and questions about his age and ability to govern.
        The poll results are troubling for Biden given Trump’s mounting legal troubles.
        Trump faces 91 criminal charges across four indictments. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. So it's troubling that voters will still prefer Trump to Biden despite his mounting legal challenges.
        Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz downplayed the polling in a statement on Sunday, November 5 telling CNN: “Predictions more than a year out tend to look a little different a year later.”
        “Coming off those historic (2022) midterms, President Biden’s campaign is hard at work reaching and mobilizing our diverse, winning coalition of voters one year out on the choice between our winning, popular agenda and MAGA Republicans’ unpopular extremism. We’ll win in 2024 by putting our heads down and doing the work, not by fretting about a poll.” Munoz said.`
